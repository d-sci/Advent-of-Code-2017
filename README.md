# Advent-of-Code-2017

Solutions to the [2017 Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017/about) using R. 

I primarily use R at my current job, and almost everything I touch there is a *data.table*. This was a nice way to get more familiar with the base R types (vector, list) and do some more 'typical' programming in R (using for/while loops, recursion, etc).  

Most of my solutions will run in a few seconds or less, though a handful take up to a couple minutes and Day 23 takes closer to half an hour per part. I attribute this partially to R being inherently inefficient at things like recursion, though I'm sure more scalable R solutions are also possible.
